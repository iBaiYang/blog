## 正文

有时候会碰到用户上传csv文件，php读取文件内容的需求，php也有相应的处理函数。

fgetcsv — 从文件指针中读入一行并解析 CSV 字段

```
 fgetcsv ( resource $handle [, int $length = 0 [, string $delimiter = ',' [, string $enclosure = '"' [, string $escape = '\\' ]]]] ) : array
```

看一个示例：
```php
$filename = '/tmp/178776443';
$lists = [];

$handle = fopen($filename, 'r');
while (($data = fgetcsv($handle, 0, ",")) !== FALSE) 
{
    foreach ($data as $k => & $v) 
    {
        $v = mb_convert_encoding($v, 'UTF-8', 'GBK');
    }
    $lists = $data;
}
fclose($handle);
```

## 函数原型

php标准库：
```
/**
 * Opens file or URL
 * @link https://php.net/manual/en/function.fopen.php
 * @param string $filename <p>
 * If filename is of the form "scheme://...", it
 * is assumed to be a URL and PHP will search for a protocol handler
 * (also known as a wrapper) for that scheme. If no wrappers for that
 * protocol are registered, PHP will emit a notice to help you track
 * potential problems in your script and then continue as though
 * filename specifies a regular file.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If PHP has decided that filename specifies
 * a local file, then it will try to open a stream on that file.
 * The file must be accessible to PHP, so you need to ensure that
 * the file access permissions allow this access.
 * If you have enabled &safemode;,
 * or open_basedir further
 * restrictions may apply.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If PHP has decided that filename specifies
 * a registered protocol, and that protocol is registered as a
 * network URL, PHP will check to make sure that
 * allow_url_fopen is
 * enabled. If it is switched off, PHP will emit a warning and
 * the fopen call will fail.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The list of supported protocols can be found in . Some protocols (also referred to as
 * wrappers) support context
 * and/or &php.ini; options. Refer to the specific page for the
 * protocol in use for a list of options which can be set. (e.g.
 * &php.ini; value user_agent used by the
 * http wrapper).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * On the Windows platform, be careful to escape any backslashes
 * used in the path to the file, or use forward slashes.
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * <?php
 * $handle = fopen("c:\\folder\\resource.txt", "r");
 * ?>
 * </pre>
 * @param string $mode <p>
 * The mode parameter specifies the type of access
 * you require to the stream. It may be any of the following:
 * <table>
 * A list of possible modes for fopen
 * using mode
 * <tr valign="top">
 * <td>mode</td>
 * <td>Description</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr valign="top">
 * <td>'r'</td>
 * <td>
 * Open for reading only; place the file pointer at the
 * beginning of the file.
 * </td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr valign="top">
 * <td>'r+'</td>
 * <td>
 * Open for reading and writing; place the file pointer at
 * the beginning of the file.
 * </td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr valign="top">
 * <td>'w'</td>
 * <td>
 * Open for writing only; place the file pointer at the
 * beginning of the file and truncate the file to zero length.
 * If the file does not exist, attempt to create it.
 * </td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr valign="top">
 * <td>'w+'</td>
 * <td>
 * Open for reading and writing; place the file pointer at
 * the beginning of the file and truncate the file to zero
 * length. If the file does not exist, attempt to create it.
 * </td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr valign="top">
 * <td>'a'</td>
 * <td>
 * Open for writing only; place the file pointer at the end of
 * the file. If the file does not exist, attempt to create it.
 * </td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr valign="top">
 * <td>'a+'</td>
 * <td>
 * Open for reading and writing; place the file pointer at
 * the end of the file. If the file does not exist, attempt to
 * create it.
 * </td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr valign="top">
 * <td>'x'</td>
 * <td>
 * Create and open for writing only; place the file pointer at the
 * beginning of the file. If the file already exists, the
 * fopen call will fail by returning false and
 * generating an error of level E_WARNING. If
 * the file does not exist, attempt to create it. This is equivalent
 * to specifying O_EXCL|O_CREAT flags for the
 * underlying open(2) system call.
 * </td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr valign="top">
 * <td>'x+'</td>
 * <td>
 * Create and open for reading and writing; place the file pointer at
 * the beginning of the file. If the file already exists, the
 * fopen call will fail by returning false and
 * generating an error of level E_WARNING. If
 * the file does not exist, attempt to create it. This is equivalent
 * to specifying O_EXCL|O_CREAT flags for the
 * underlying open(2) system call.
 * </td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Different operating system families have different line-ending
 * conventions. When you write a text file and want to insert a line
 * break, you need to use the correct line-ending character(s) for your
 * operating system. Unix based systems use \n as the
 * line ending character, Windows based systems use \r\n
 * as the line ending characters and Macintosh based systems use
 * \r as the line ending character.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you use the wrong line ending characters when writing your files, you
 * might find that other applications that open those files will "look
 * funny".
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Windows offers a text-mode translation flag ('t')
 * which will transparently translate \n to
 * \r\n when working with the file. In contrast, you
 * can also use 'b' to force binary mode, which will not
 * translate your data. To use these flags, specify either
 * 'b' or 't' as the last character
 * of the mode parameter.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The default translation mode depends on the SAPI and version of PHP that
 * you are using, so you are encouraged to always specify the appropriate
 * flag for portability reasons. You should use the 't'
 * mode if you are working with plain-text files and you use
 * \n to delimit your line endings in your script, but
 * expect your files to be readable with applications such as notepad. You
 * should use the 'b' in all other cases.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you do not specify the 'b' flag when working with binary files, you
 * may experience strange problems with your data, including broken image
 * files and strange problems with \r\n characters.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For portability, it is strongly recommended that you always
 * use the 'b' flag when opening files with fopen.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Again, for portability, it is also strongly recommended that
 * you re-write code that uses or relies upon the 't'
 * mode so that it uses the correct line endings and
 * 'b' mode instead.
 * </p>
 * @param bool $use_include_path [optional] <p>
 * The optional third use_include_path parameter
 * can be set to '1' or true if you want to search for the file in the
 * include_path, too.
 * </p>
 * @param resource $context [optional] &note.context-support;
 * @return resource|false a file pointer resource on success, or false on error.
 */
function fopen ($filename, $mode, $use_include_path = false, $context = null) {}

/**
 * Closes an open file pointer
 * @link https://php.net/manual/en/function.fclose.php
 * @param resource $stream <p>

 * fsockopen.
 * </p>
 * @param int $length [optional] <p>
 * Must be greater than the longest line (in characters) to be found in
 * the CSV file (allowing for trailing line-end characters). It became
 * optional in PHP 5. Omitting this parameter (or setting it to 0 in PHP
 * 5.0.4 and later) the maximum line length is not limited, which is
 * slightly slower.
 * </p>
 * @param string $separator [optional] <p>
 * Set the field delimiter (one character only).
 * </p>
 * @param string $enclosure [optional] <p>
 * Set the field enclosure character (one character only).

 * comprising a single null field, and will not be treated
