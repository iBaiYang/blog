## 正文

在官网下载最新版[Oracle VM VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) 、 [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads)，安装。

在Centos官网下载Vagrant支持的[box](https://app.vagrantup.com/centos/boxes/7)。

把box移动到 `G:\virtualbox\centos78\box` 下，改名为 `centos78.box`。

win+R，输入cmd打开命令行，切换到 目标盘位置：
> g:
> cd virtualbox\centos78

添加vagrant box：
> vagrant box add centos7.8 box/CentOS7.8.box

用init初始化：
> vagrant init

初始化后，我们会在`G:virtualbox\centos78`下看到新增了一个文件`Vagrantfile`：
```
# -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :

# All Vagrant configuration is done below. The "2" in Vagrant.configure
# configures the configuration version (we support older styles for
# backwards compatibility). Please don't change it unless you know what
# you're doing.
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  # The most common configuration options are documented and commented below.
  # For a complete reference, please see the online documentation at
  # https://docs.vagrantup.com.

  # Every Vagrant development environment requires a box. You can search for
  # boxes at https://vagrantcloud.com/search.
  config.vm.box = "base"

  # Disable automatic box update checking. If you disable this, then
  # boxes will only be checked for updates when the user runs
  # `vagrant box outdated`. This is not recommended.
  # config.vm.box_check_update = false

  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
  # accessing "localhost:8080" will access port 80 on the guest machine.
  # NOTE: This will enable public access to the opened port
  # config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080

  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine and only allow access
  # via 127.0.0.1 to disable public access
  # config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080, host_ip: "127.0.0.1"

  # Create a private network, which allows host-only access to the machine
  # using a specific IP.
  # config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10"

  # Create a public network, which generally matched to bridged network.
  # Bridged networks make the machine appear as another physical device on
  # your network.
  # config.vm.network "public_network"

  # Share an additional folder to the guest VM. The first argument is
  # the path on the host to the actual folder. The second argument is
  # the path on the guest to mount the folder. And the optional third
  # argument is a set of non-required options.
  # config.vm.synced_folder "../data", "/vagrant_data"

  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various
  # backing providers for Vagrant. These expose provider-specific options.
  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
  # config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
  #   # Display the VirtualBox GUI when booting the machine
  #   vb.gui = true
  #
  #   # Customize the amount of memory on the VM:
  #   vb.memory = "1024"
  # end
  #
  # View the documentation for the provider you are using for more
  # information on available options.

  # Enable provisioning with a shell script. Additional provisioners such as
  # Ansible, Chef, Docker, Puppet and Salt are also available. Please see the
  # documentation for more information about their specific syntax and use.
  # config.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
  #   apt-get update
  #   apt-get install -y apache2
  # SHELL
end
```

修改这个配置文件，像这样：
```
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "centos78"
  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 80
  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 3306, host: 3306
  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 9801, host: 9801
  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 9805, host: 9805
  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 9901, host: 9901
  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 9905, host: 9905
  config.vm.synced_folder "G:/www", "/var/www", create:true, owner:"vagrant", group:"vagrant"
  config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/vagrant", disabled: true
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
  vb.memory = "2048"
  vb.cpus = "2"
  end
```
