关于心理健康：

Mental fitness is very much like physical fitness; they both require regular training. 
Just as you become physically fit by exercising your body, you become mentally fit by exercising your mind. 
You build your physical muscles by working in them continuously. 
You build your mental muscles, your levels of self-esteem, self-respect and self-confidence, 
by working on them in specific ways as well.

心理健康与身体健康非常相似，两者都需要经常锻炼。你通过锻炼身体来保持身体上的健康，同样需要通过心理锻炼来保持心理健康；
你通过持续的锻炼来增强自己的肌肉组织，同样需要以某种方式来增加你的自尊和自信。


You eat healthy, nutritious foods every day to nourish and sustain high levels of physical health and energy. 
In the same way, you feed your mind with healthy mental foods every day to keep yourself cheerful, 
optimistic, and upbeat, no matter what happens.

你每天吃有益健康、有营养的食品来保证身体健康和精力旺盛，同样，你应该每天汲取健康的心理食品，
从而使自己无论发生什么事情都能保持乐观、积极的态度。

关于个人潜力：

I realize that everyone who is at the top in any field was once at the bottom. 
Everyone who is at the front of the line today was once at the back of the line. 
Everyone who is at the top of the ladder of success was once at the bottom of the ladder, 
and climbed up, one rung at a time. Everyone who is doing well in your field was at one time not in your field at all.

我意识到：每一个现在处于事业颠峰的人都曾经处于事业的最底层，每一个现在处于前沿的人也曾经落后过，
每一个爬上了成功阶梯的人也曾经在梯子下面，然后一次一级地向上爬。你所在领域内的杰出人物以前可能根本不在这个领域之内。

The truth is that you are just as good, and potentially better in many areas, than anyone else you will ever meet. 
If you decide to be the best in your field, the only person who can stop you from achieving it is yourself. 
The limits to excellent performance are inner attitudes of mind, not the outer aspects of your life.

事实是，你和别人一样优秀，甚至在许多领域比你遇上的任何一个人更具有潜力。如果你想成为业内最好的，
唯一可能阻止你实现这个目标的人就是你自己。限制你成就的是你内心的状态，而不是你外在的条件。

关于阅读习惯：

In order to stay on top of your job, you should read in your field at least one hour per day, 
underlining and taking good notes. Anything less than one hour per day will put you in danger or being passed by your competitors. 
The rule is that to earn more, you must learn more.

要想在工作中出类拔萃，你应该每天都读一小时的专业书籍，培养一种认真记笔记的好习惯。如果少了那一小时的专业阅读，
你很有可能会被你的竞争对手甩在后面。有条法则是：若想挣得更多，你就必须学得更多。

If you read just one hour per day, that will amount to about one book per week. 
One book per week will amount to about 50 books per year. 
Fifty books per year will totally about 500 books over the next 10 years. 
At the very least, you will need a bigger house just to hold your books, 
and you will probably be able to afford it as well.

如果你每天读一小时的书，那么加起来，你每星期就会读完一本书；而每周一本书，加起来每年就是50本书；
每年50本书，就意味着在未来的十年里，你将会读完500本书。到那时，你需要一个大一点的房子来收藏这些书；
到那时，你会发现自己已经完全有能力买下一栋大房子了。

### 成功学

“Never complain, never explain. Resist the temptation to defend yourself or make excuses.”

“Successful people are always looking for opportunities to help others. Unsuccessful people are always asking, "What's in it for me?”

“You cannot control what happens to you, but you can control your attitude toward what happens to you, 
and in that, you will be mastering change rather than allowing it to master you.”

“It doesn't matter where you are coming from. All that matters is where you are going.”

“Positive expectations are the mark of the superior personality.”

“Develop an attitude of gratitude, and give thanks for everything that happens to you, 
knowing that every step forward is a step toward achieving something bigger and better than your current situation.”

“Love only grows by sharing. You can only have more for yourself by giving it away to others.”

“Look for the good in every person and every situation. You'll almost always find it.”

“I've found that luck is quite predictable. If you want more luck, take more chances, Be more active, Show up more often.”

“Everything you do is triggered by an emotion of either desire or fear.”

“The act of taking the first step is what separates the winners from the losers.”

“The only real limitation on your abilities is the level of your desires. 
If you want it badly enough, there are no limits on what you can achieve.”

“Whatever you believe with feeling becomes your reality.”

“You have within you, right now, everything you need to deal with whatever the world can throw at you.”

“The ability to discipline yourself to delay gratification in the short term in order to enjoy greater rewards 
in the long term is the indispensable prerequisite for success.”

“All successful people men and women are big dreamers. They imagine what their future could be, 
ideal in every respect, and then they work every day toward their distant vision, that goal or purpose.”

“If you wish to achieve worthwhile things in your personal and career life, 
you must become a worthwhile person in your own self-development.”

“Always choose the future over the past. What do we do now?”

“The potential of the average person is like a huge ocean unsailed, a new continent unexplored, 
a world of possibilities waiting to be released and channeled toward some great good.”

“The way you give your name to others is a measure of how much you like and respect yourself.”

“Excellence/Perfection is not a destination; it is a continuous journey that never ends.”

“Every minute you spend in planning saves 10 minutes in execution; this gives you a 1,000 percent Return on Energy!”

“The more you seek security, the less of it you have. But the more you seek opportunity, 
the more likely it is that you will achieve the security that you desire.”

“Imagine no limitations; decide what's right and desirable before you decide what's possible.”

“The more credit you give away, the more will come back to you. 
The more you help others, the more they will want to help you.”

“Never say anything about yourself you don't want to come true”

“Always give without remembering and always receive without forgetting.”

“Communication is a skill that you can learn. It's like riding a bicycle or typing. 
If you're willing to work at it, you can rapidly improve the quality of very part of your life.”
